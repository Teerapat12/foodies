I could write a parser to extract the text .. but I'm sure if 10 people want to access this data we all don't want to all write parser just to get the data. One way I can think of is to have another column that only store the text of the review itself. It is also useful if we wnat the text only for some part of the website later on in the development.\n",
    "2. I assume most of them is a test review. Are there anyway that we can recognize them as test later? We have few rows so it is fine now but imagine if reviews grows to 60K, where 20K it test review. We should have way to separate them early on so that our life will be easier.\n",
